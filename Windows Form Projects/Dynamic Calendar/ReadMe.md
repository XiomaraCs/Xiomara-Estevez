Dynamic Calendar: An example of using C# language with Windows Form Applications, on Visual Studio IDE. 
The build uses .NET SDK, C#.

Provided below is a gif showing a successful build of the calendar, which is able to iterate through the months, and able to pick several days. 
The program uses a basic template created to wrap the days around a 7 panel that becomes the days of the week (monday-friday). This way is quicker than having to make each element seperate.

This is an example of a calendar that can be used to pick a range of dates: 
(ex: picking flight days for a plane ticket, scheduling day requests for a service, etc.)
